description: In this study, real-time imaging was used to visualize individual electropores
  and demonstrate their persistence in electroporated cells. HEK 923 cells were cultured
  on Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)-coated coverslips and loaded with the Cal520 fluorescent
  indicator for visualization. Real-time imaging was performed in Total Internal Reflection
  Fluorescent (TIRF) mode. Electrophysiological manipulations were applied using a
  patch clamp in voltage clamp mode, set in a whole-cell configuration. The protocol
  included a command voltage of 0 mV interrupted by a -50 mV pulse for 50 ms and a
  -400 mV pulse for 1 ms at frame 91, returning to -50 mV for 50 ms. Additionally,
  0.4 seconds into the second and third stacks, the command voltage was changed from
  0 mV to -50 mV for 50 ms. The study was supported in part by NIH 15R21EY034803 and
  NIH 1R21EY034258.
